# Step 1: Create two tensors and an addition operation

# Step 2: Create a second graph and make it the default graph

# Step 3: Create two tensors in the second graph and a subtraction operation

# Step 4: Create a session and execute the addition operation from the first graph

# Step 5: Create a second session and execute the subtraction operation from the second graph
